# Tauri Plus Bevy

This is a very strange given bevy runs in WASM or most desktop platforms, but I
was curious whether I could get bevy to run as a backend for a tauri app. I
guess it worked, but I'm not sure that's a good thing.

If I stopped and thought about it for more than a few seconds I'd probably think
of better ways to do this, but here it is anyway.

I wrote up the process here https://willhart.io/post/headless-bevy-in-a-tauri-app/
